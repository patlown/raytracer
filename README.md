### dev log

**01-18-2025**
- set up basic zig project
- set up drawing a circle to stdout using 'x' and '.'

**01-19-2025**
- turned it 3d
- used llm to write sphere intersection function
- learned a lot of vector math
- need to revisit get_pixel, not sure the correct way to solve this yet but got it working


**01-23-2025**
- the math is a little annoying, used llm to help me clean up get_pixel and sphere_intersection
- need to render two spheres now, core math algorithms are done so this should be easier
